# Macchiato Theme! ‚òïÔ∏è+ü•õ

macchiato it's a [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) theme based on [Theme Boilerplate](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate) and [Caffeine Theme](https://github.com/kelyvin/jsonresume-theme-caffeine).

## Why?

I wanted to build my own resume theme, so I decided to start from a theme I like a lot and tring to make it a bit more personal.

I also wanted I simple environment, so I used the boilerplate provided by JSON Resume instead of using the awesome work done by [kelyvin](https://github.com/kelyvin/) for it's Caffeine Theme. If you are looking for a more complete environment take a look at the caffine theme


Currently it doesn't have any major style difference from it's parent [Caffeine](https://github.com/kelyvin/jsonresume-theme-caffeine).

## Changes from Caffeine Theme

- Simpler and less sofisticated development environment, the same as JSON Resume boilerplate. (Caffeine has live re-building and automatic page reloading)

### Visual differences
- Add tags to projects and skills
- Switch from UPPERCASE to Capitalize on most text


## Usage

1. Download [JSON Resume CLI](https://jsonresume.org/)
  `npm install -g resume-cli`

1. Download the theme from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (if you)
  `npm install -g jsonresume-theme-macchiato`

1. Use resume cli to build your resume
  `resume export resume.html --theme macchiato`
